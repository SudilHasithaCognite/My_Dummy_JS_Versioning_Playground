# My_Dummy_JS_Versioning_Playground

Trying to verify the CI/CD pipeline of the JS-SDK is working as it is intended. And the lerna versioning is working as expected when performing NPM releases.

This repo contains three packages or projects:

- `header` (a library of React components)
- `footer` (a library of React components)
- `remixapp` (an app written using the Remix framework which depends on both `header` and `footer`)

- Updated the readme as chore

```
packages/
    header/
        src/
            ...
        package.json
        rollup.config.json
        jest.config.js

    footer/
        src/
            ...
        package.json
        rollup.config.json
        jest.config.js

    remixapp/
        app/
            ...
        public/
        package.json
        remix.config.js

package.json
```
